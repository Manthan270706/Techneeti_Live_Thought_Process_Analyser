# 💡 Live Technical Thought Process Analyser

## 📌 Overview

The **Live Technical Thought Process Analyser** is a real-time process analysis dashboard designed to **analyze how candidates solve coding problems in real-time**, not just their final solution.
It captures **key logs, keystrokes, Paste events, code runs, no of edits, refactors, and timeline events** while integrating with **Worqhat API** for **code analysis and NLP feedback**.

This project was built as part of a hackathon to showcase **next-gen interview evaluation tools** that focus on *problem-solving methodology* rather than only final outputs.
